        <h2 data-enter="3">This person has been talking about a new product idea</h2>
        <h2 data-enter="4">It can't be a crappy idea. <span data-enter="5">If it is then bide your time like a mysterious bridge troll</span></h2>

        <h1>Option 4: The management sneak</h1>
        <h2 data-enter="2">It is going to take you 2 weeks of nights and weekends</h2>
        <h2 data-enter="3">You're going to feel like Andy from The Shawshank Redemption crawling to freedom through the poo pipe</h2>
